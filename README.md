DENSITY ESTIMATION AND CLASSIFICATION
The project consists of implementation of the Na√Øve Bayes classifier that
assumes that the features are independent of each other. Given 10000 training
examples, 5000 handwritten digit zero and 5000 handwritten digits one, the
algorithm has to model a classifier based on the training set and determines
whether the given image is a 0 or 1.
